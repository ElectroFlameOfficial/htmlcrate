# Getting Started:

Since you can't really use HTMLCrate without a hosting service, i suggest you either use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a webserver that can run Apache2, like [Google Cloud's Compute Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com)

> **Note:** In HTMLCrate, The code will usually be *mostly* prettified.

- Go over to the [Official Website](http://electroflame.me/htmlcrate/index.html) and download the base ZIP File.

- Unzip the files and open them in your favorite text editor, like Visual Studio Code, Atom, Or Sublime Text.

- Replace all instances of HTMLCrate with your own List's name.

> **Note:** It is a good habit to check your new changes before saving.

Congrats! You are now ready to add your list's levels onto the website!

Stay Tuned for more! :)
