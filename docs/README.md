# HTMLCrate

**Welcome to the HTMLCrate documentation!**

First off, let's get to know the basic workflow of using HTMLCrate.
HTMLCrate is designed for ease of access, readability, and accessibility.

To be clear, you do NOT have to delete and remake your Copy when you break something, just use `ctrl+z`

> **Note:** You need to be familiar with html, css, and js to be able to fix any errors.

The first part of this documentation is an introduction to the features of HTMLCrate, divided into courses. Read the [Getting Started](Introduction/getting_started.md) course to get started!
